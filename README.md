# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
3. **Recommender Systems**
4. **Reinforcement Learning**

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning refers to algorithms that learn an input-to-output mapping (labels). You provide your algorithm with examples to learn from.

#### Types of Supervised Learning:

1. **Regression:**

   1.1 **Linear Regression Model**  
   1.2 **Multiple Linear Regression Model**  
   1.3 **Polynomial Linear Regression Model**

2. **Classification:**
